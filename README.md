Analytical solution of dihedral fitting

The script ‘K_fit.py’ calculates (fits) Fourier parameters for dihedral energy part (in force field equation).
As a input it takes the following data files. First, the energy of a molecule for different conformations is demanded.
It can be obtained using quantum chemistry methods. The second file should include energies for the same states 
but without dihedral part (parameters are set to zero). The last input files consist of dihedral angles of a molecule
which were considered (one dih file for every dihedral angle).

According to the formula in cited paper, the script calculates the estimated value of torsion part based on the given energy values.
The calculated parameters are selected in that way to minimize the square of the difference between corresponding energies
from the first and second file.
All torsion angles can be grouped according to their types.
For instance the torsion angle formed from OH.8-P.6-OS.10-CT atoms belongs to the same group as this one: CT.1-OS.5-P.6-OH.8.

The same set of four parameters K1, K2, K3, K4 applies to every dihedral of a given type.
The ‘K_fit.py’ script optionally expects two values ‘from’ and ‘to’ 
which set the range of the resulting parameters K. These optionally values 
and mandatory paths to data files the script gets from the standard input or text file with paths to QM energy,
MM energy and all dihedral angles files.

In the result, the script returns the set of optimal Fourier or Ryckaert-Belleman (RB) parameters for each dihedral types 
and optionally set of Fourier parameters from declared range for each dihedral types. 
The cited work includes the method of obtaining Ryckaert-Belleman parameters based on Fourier ones.


usage:

./K_fit.py from to < paths2files.txt  > coefficients.out

options:

from, to	    optionally two values ‘from’ and ‘to’ which set the range of the resulting parameters K.
				The calculated K parameters should be included inside this range. This option is only for Fourier parameters.

path2files.txt  includes paths to data files: 
                     path to QM energy file,
                     MM energy file,
                     *.dih files,
                     the amount of coefficients to calculate (3 or 4 value is allowed),
		     and type of coefficients: Fourier or RB (Ryckaert-Belleman).

data files:

QM energy file	the energy of a molecule for different conformations with respect to the most stable conformer e.g. relative energy values from Gaussian used as a base for making a 			fit. Values (in kJ/mol - the unit has to be the same like in MM energy file) should have column layout.

MM energy file	the relative energy of a molecule for different conformations (with respect to the most stable) calculated with K's parameters set to 0. Values (in kJ/mol - the unit 			has to be the same like in QM energy file) should have column layout.


*.dih files 	with values of all dihedrals in molecule for different conformations. Values should have column layout. 
				The first line in each files containing the type of dihedral: order of the atoms forming that angle. 
				e.g. 'P.6-OS.10-CT.11-HC.14.dih' file in first line should have: 'P OS CT HC'.
				Ordering of values in all *.dih files is the same, so rows are related across all files.

coffType        return the Ryckaert-Belleman coefficients instead of Fourier ones.

coff            amount of Fourier coefficients to calculte. Default is 4, another possible one is 3

All QM, MM and *.dih files should include data in the same order which corresponds to the mutual relationship.

The path to those files are included in paths2files.txt

output:

In the result, the script returns the set optimal Fourier or RB parameters for each dihedral types 
and optionally set of Fourier/RB parameters from declared range for each dihedral types. 
The values are in JSON data interchange format.
